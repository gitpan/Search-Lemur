Search-Lemur


This module will make it easy to interact with a Lemur
Toolkit for Language Modeling and Information Retrieval 
server for information retreival exercises.  For more
information on Lemur, see http://www.lemurproject.org/.  

This module takes care of all parsing of responses from
the server. You can just pass a query as a 
space-separated list of terms, and the module will give
you back an array of result objects.
